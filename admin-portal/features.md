Step 1: Set Up the Core Structure

    Goal: Get the basic framework running so that you can navigate between a few key pages.
    What to Do:
        Set up your project structure with Vite, React, TypeScript, and react-router-dom.
        Create the basic routes for:
            /login (Login page)
            /dashboard (Admin dashboard)
        Ensure that users can navigate between these pages using links or redirects.

Step 2: Build the Authentication System

    Goal: Ensure only authorized users (admins/employees) can access the admin portal.
    What to Do:
        Set up a login page (/login) and use JWT or session-based authentication.
        Create a protected route for the dashboard so that only authenticated users can access it.
        Once authentication is in place, employees will be able to log in and see the dashboard.

Step 3: Dashboard and Event Management

    Goal: Start by building the dashboard and event management sections.
    What to Do:
        Create the Dashboard route (/dashboard) with basic stats (e.g., number of events, upcoming events).
        Build the Event Management page (/events) to list events.
        Add basic functionality for viewing, creating, and editing events (/events/new, /events/:id/edit).

Step 4: Connect to the Backend (CRUD Operations)

    Goal: Integrate the frontend with the backend API to manage data.
    What to Do:
        Set up basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for events.
        Use Axios or Fetch to connect to your Node.js API, and create the basic database models in PostgreSQL.

Step 5: Ticket Management

    Goal: Implement the ticket management system for events.
    What to Do:
        Add the route for managing tickets (/events/:id/tickets).
        Implement functionality to create and manage ticket types, set prices, and check availability.
